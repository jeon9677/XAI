> **Deep Generative Modeling with Spatial and Network Images: An Explainable AI (XAI) Approach**

This Python package provides flexible deep learning building blocks for spatial generative modeling, inspired by the methods proposed in the paper:

**Deep Generative Modeling with Spatial and Network Images: An Explainable AI (XAI) Approach**

---

## Overview

This package implements reusable model architectures and training utilities for spatially structured data.  
It combines:
- Spatial coordinates
- Covariate effects
- Spatial random effects

and supports Monte Carlo dropout for **explainable uncertainty estimation** (XAI).
